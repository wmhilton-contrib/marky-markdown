# 8.0.0 (DATE TBD)

### New Features / Breaking Changes

- changed the way certain links are auto-generated (i.e., linkifying
  `www.example.com` but not `readme.md`) so as to more closely match
  how Github does it ([pull/151], [issue/146]); thanks to [puzrin]
  for help working out the details
- `<` and `>` are no longer allowed in auto-linked text due to a
  sub-dependency update coming in from `markdown-it` (see below, also
  [linkify-it/26] for details)
- we now allow [link reference definitions] to appear immediately
  following paragraphs rather than requiring a blank link in between
  them; this contradicts
  [CommonMark](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.24/#example-172) but
  matches Github's behavior. ([issue/159], [pull/164])
- we now support Github flavored markdown [task lists] in markdown
  documents. ([issue/166], [pull/168])
- we no longer strip HTML `<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>` elements from
  embedded markup, so you can write definition lists. HOWEVER: these
  are not directly supported by any particular standard Markdown
  syntax; since they are treated as inline HTML, any lines indented
  with four or more spaces will get rendered as code blocks as per
  CommonMark; see the discussion in [issue/169]. ([pull/170])

#### CommonMark 0.24

Due to the update to `markdown-it` (see below), our markdown parsing now uses CommonMark 0.24 as a baseline. The [CommonMark 0.24 Changelog] has the details; the main interesting parts are:

  - setext headings can span multiple lines now

    ```
    This didn't work as a heading before
    but now it does
    =========
    ```

  - link destinations can no longer contain spaces, even when surrounded by angle brackets

    ```
    [link text](<this used to be valid.html>)
    ```

  - valid link schemes used to be enumerated ('http', 'https', 'ftp', etc...); now they're defined as "any sequence	of 2--32 characters beginning with an ASCII letter and followed by any combination of ASCII letters, digits, or the symbols plus ('+'), period ('.'), or hyphen ('-')"

### Bug Fixes

- if you invoke marky with `{highlightSyntax: false}` in the options,
  we no longer apply the syntax highlighting-related CSS classes to
  the rendered HTML; e.g., rather than
  `<div class="highlight js"><pre class="editor editor-colors">...</pre></div>`
  we will render simply `<pre><code>...</code></pre>`. ([issue/162],
  [pull/163])

[pull/163]: https://github.com/npm/marky-markdown/pull/163

# 7.0.1 (2016-05-28)

- removed some unused configuration option handling from the process
  by which we wrap markdown code blocks ([pull/154])

### Tests

- unit tests were breaking when dependencies's READMEs weren't in
  our file tree (specifically mocha, a devDependency); now we skip
  trying to process those ([pull/184])
- a dependency was leaking a variable into the global scope; now we
  test for that; thanks [aredridel]! ([issue/180], [pull/186])
- added some tests to make sure marky doesn't accidentally do
  mustache template variable replacement ([issue/160], [pull/161])


### Dependencies

- `glob` updated to `7.0.0` ([pull/150])
- `lodash.pickBy` updated to `4.2.1` ([pull/155])

# 7.0.0 (2016-02-08)

### Breaking Changes

- updated `markdown-it` to `5.1.0` that broke the behavior of
  fenced code blocks. updated tests to reflect new behavior.
  ([pull/100]) by [revin]
- we were seeing rendering issues because `markdown-it` does not
  do anything with tab characters in fenced code blocks. we now
  convert tab characters into four-spaces, which follows Github
  flavored markdown ([issue/126],[pull/127]) by [revin]
- converts emoji in heading IDs to emoji shortcode names to more
  closely match Github flavored markdown ([issue/128], [pull/133])

# 6.0.4 (2016-02-08)

### Documentation

- badges about the time til close for PRs and issues were added to
  the `README` by [ashleygwilliams]
- a line about `:emoji:` conversion was added to the `README` by
  [revin]
- a trailing comma in the options description was removed by [revin]

### Tests

- originally we were installing some packages as `devDependencies` in 
  order to use their `README`s in tests. this became an issue when
  greenkeeper would attempt to update them and break our tests :) 
  we now have pulled in the `README`s as static assets ([issue/91]
  [pull/114]), by [revin]
- tests were all in a single file, broken up in categories
  ([issue/122], [pull/123]) by [revin]
- test coverage was greatly improved ([pull/138]) by [revin]
  - our `packagize` module would error out if the package provided,
    lacked a name, `if()` guard added
  - ensure that `cdn` module bails if there isn't sufficient package
    data supplied
  - add a few lines to  `github.md` test fixture to make sure it
    handles `<img>` elements with a blank/missing `src` attribute
    and `<a>` elements with a blank/missing `href`
  - ensure running marky with `{debug: true}` produces the same output
    as normal execution

  filter, but the intent was to only allow actual YouTube URLs.

  but had not been used in a while. was finally fully removed

# 6.0.3 (2016-01-14)

### Bug Fix

- we strip `h1` tags from `README`s that have the same content as the
  package name, however we did not update this feature to account for
  scoped package names, e.g. @scope/pkg. now we remove the scope from
  the package meta-data to check the `README`'s `h1`. 
  ([issue/48][pull/103]) - reported by [sindresorhus], solved by [revin]

  ([issue/95], [pull/97]) - reported by [cloakedninjas], solved by [revin]

# 6.0.1 (2016-01-07)

### Bug Fix

- `markdown-it@5.1.0` would break the build, so `package.json` was updated
